Hi, I am Cesare.

I am from Italy but live in Pennsylvania.

Three words that describe me are: curious, quiet, creative.

My favorite hobby is cooking and making bread and pastry.

My favorite means of transportation is a bicycle. I love riding my bike, but
can't ride much here because there are too many hills.
